# Bitcoin_LogReg_Classifier

This is a project of a Classifier to predict whether to go long, short or stay in position based on a triple barrier method (with fixed treshold) for labelling the data, and some trading indicators as features. As an example I use the BTCUSDT futures to train and evaluate the model.
